# Food-Order-Billing-System
Food order billing system is based on a concept of ordering food items and generating total food cost. There’s no login system in this mini project. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.

Introduction

The Food Ordering System Project is a console-based application developed with
the C++ programming language.
Billing system is like a data warehouse for the restaurant, through the transactions
recorded there, we can make sense of customer preferences, offers that are
working, dishes that are being loved, outlets that are performing well and so
much more.

Purpose / Objective

To save printing and postage costs.
To reduces deadlines and streamlines business workflow through unified invoicing
processing.
To gain efficiency and reduce human errors.
To ease billing operations by automation and improves the overall customer
experience

Action

Talking about the features of the simple food order system, the user has to
select ‘s’ to start the order, after that user has to choose category of items from
veg and nonveg.
Then user has to choose the items from the list of foods, users can add other
items also from the list. After this, the system displays the total bill of the
customer.

Skills & Accomplishments

It allows hotel / restaurant customers place orders for foods from their tables
remotely.
The system displays a systematic menu of the items available at the restaurant
along with the price of the respective item.
The system allows the client to place their orders easily. The client is allowed to
keep ordering and reordering items from the menu as many times they want
and stop when they are done and don’t want to place any further orders.
The system calculates and generates a systematic bill according to the price
and quantity of items ordered by the customer.
Although graphics has not been used in this project, the application of user
defined functions and structures have been effectively used here.
